# Todo-App

Create a Todo application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(NO FRAMEWORK!)

<!-- PROJECT INFO -->

Traditionally, beginners often choose to build a todo application as their first project. I decided to create a simple, but more unique todo application. This project will demomstrate my understanding of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, throughout the process I learned a variety of advanced methods and coding techniques I can use for future projects. This project was built without any type of framework.

<!-- HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS -->

Unlike traditional todo applications, this application has its own original UI experience.
The user is introduced to a grid layout that has 5 containers, each built to create and manage all list items. To get started, the user must create their first list item. Once the item is created, it will appear in the first dropzone called "New Item". Now that the item is fully created, your able to drag and drop your item into any available container, such as New Items, Active Items, and Completed Items. One other special feature is that users are able to search through list items using the search container.
